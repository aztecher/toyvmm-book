## What is ToyVMM?

ToyVMM is a project being developed for the purpose of learning virtualization technology.
ToyVMM aims to accomplish the following

Code-based understanding of KVM-based virtualization technologies
Learn about the modern virtualization technology stack by using libraries managed by rust-vmm
The rust-vmm libraries are also used as a base for well-known OSS such as firecracker and provides the functionality needed to create custom VMMs.
